Welcome to The eXastum Project.

=={LICENCING}===========================================================

	Two licences cover content in The eXastum Project.

	1. All source code falls under the terms of this licence:
	   https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
	
	2. Artistic works such as icons and sounds fall under this licence:
	   https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode
	   
	Basically what this means is for both code and artistic works you 
	modify and share as long as you also share your changes and do not 
	profit from them. While only the CC licence disallows commercial use 
	in the licence the nature of the GNU GPL basically also makes it 
	impossible as you must make source code available and allow sharing.
