Welcome to eXastum 2.0 Nova, the HTML5 desktop/os by Brian Millar.

To begin simply open eXastum.html in Google Chrome or Chromium.
I am working hard on adding Firefox support in the near future.

If you are confused by any part of the system or just can't 
get something to work the way it should then please send an
email to brianmillar9@yahoo.com and help will be provided, 
there is now a new Facebook page for Ontropy Software you
can find it at facebook.com/ontropy.

By using this software you agree to the terms of the GNU General Public Licence v3
and the extra terms I have added under Section 7 (deals with giving credit in your forks).

Enjoy using eXastum and thank you for your interest in the project.
